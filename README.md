# Perceptron Model Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron, a fundamental binary classifier in machine learning. This implementation is built using Python and demonstrates the basic workings of the Perceptron algorithm.

## Features

- Simple Perceptron model
- Binary classification using unit step activation function
- Usage of NumPy for efficient numerical computations

## Requirements

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Files

perceptron.py: The main Python script containing the perceptron model.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the perceptron.py file.
3. Run the script from the terminal:

```bash

python perceptron.py
```

This will execute the perceptron training on a sample dataset and output the predictions on a test dataset.

## Example

After you run the script, you should see the predicted classes output in the console. The data is randomly generated, so results will vary each time the script is run.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes or improvements.
